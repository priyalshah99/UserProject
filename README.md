This is very basic implementation for demonstration of Spring, JPA with Thymeleaf as frontend.

Prerequisites:
1. Database : MySQL
2. Create an empty schema named "user_project"
2. Database config : Please update the database connection details in application.properties

Demo:
1. Run the application
2. Hit URL to browser : http://localhost:8080/login
3. Click on "Register" and fill up form to register the user.
4. Login to the system with given credentials.
5. Post login, you can perform simple CRUD operations.
6. This will allow you to edit/delete/retrieve.

Notes:
1.A very basic and simple UI is implemented.
2.As thymeleaf is used, have not created Rest APIs in the bcakend.
3.The objective assumed was a working flow from frontend->backend->db and vice versa.
